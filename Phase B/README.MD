# NODUS - ADHD Sympyom Detection in Children Using Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Vocal Analysis, and Possible Solutions.

<h2>Phase B: Implementing</h2>
<p>
Phase B was dedicated to the implementation of the system as outlined in the planning phase. We began by setting up the development environment and integrating the various tools and libraries required for the project, including Django for the web framework, OpenCV for computer vision tasks, and TensorFlow for building the deep learning model. The implementation phase involved developing the eye-tracking and vocal analysis modules, designing and coding the web interface, and creating the deep learning model to process the data. We also focused on rigorous testing and validation to ensure that each component worked seamlessly and accurately. This phase culminated in the integration of all system components into a functional, user-friendly platform capable of detecting ADHD in children.</p>
