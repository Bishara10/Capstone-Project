# NODUS - ADHD Sympyom Detection in Children Using Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Vocal Analysis, and Possible Solutions.

<h2>Phase A: Planning</h2>
<p>
During Phase A, our primary focus was on thoroughly planning and designing the architecture of the ADHD detection system. This phase involved extensive research into existing methodologies for detecting ADHD, particularly through eye-tracking and vocal analysis. We defined the projectâ€™s scope, identified the necessary tools and technologies, and established clear milestones. Additionally, we created detailed system architecture diagrams and flowcharts to map out the interactions between the different components of the system, including the web interface, data processing modules, and the deep learning model. This planning phase was crucial in ensuring that the project would be implemented effectively and would meet the desired outcomes.</p>
