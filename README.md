# NODUS - ADHD Detection in Children Using Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Vocal Analysis, and Possible Solutions.

<h2>Overview</h2>
Software Engineering capstone project for detecting adhd in children, incorporating computer vision, vocal analysis and deep learning, accessible by a simple, user friendly WEB interface.
Our program will provide eye-detection along with vocal tests, which will track the patient's eye movements and vocal performance, that will be later analyzed by our deep learning model for detecting ADHD, providing an overall ADHD assessment with possible solutions.
<br><br>
Eye tests will check the patient's focus in a busy environment, by tracking eye movements, how much the user has deviated his vision from the target which the patient is expected to focus on, and other various parameters such as response time.
Vocal tests will measure patient's voice frequencies, pitch, and will check for strainness, hoarseness and breathiness, which are considered main area of focus with regards to detecting ADHD with vocal performance.
The two set of tests mentioned above are specifically chosen to be the primary source of data, due to their researched and proven reliability for providing an accurate ADHD detection.
Furthermore, following the 2 main tests, the program will ask to fill a questionnaire about the patient's overall behavior, history of displaying symptoms of the disorder, nature of the patient's environment and socioeconomic factors. The questionnaires can be filled by the patient, thier parents/caregivers and optionally their teachers.
<br><br>
Our deep learning model will analyze the test results performed by the patient along with the questionnaires, allowing for more accurate detection, and will then provide an overall assessment of the patient's ADHD main type(s): Hyperactivity, inattentiveness, or combined, along with possible solutions to cope with the disorder and further plans.

<h2>The code for the entire NODUS system can be found in the Django folder found in this repository. Additionally you can find the presentations and project books in folders Phase A and Phase B</h2>
